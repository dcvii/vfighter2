|PREFACE TO VF1 FAQ|
+==================+
Different is good.

Lately, gamers have been hit pretty hard by a barrage of fighting games
ranging from those whose only draw is blood and guts to those who resemble
a sick horse that should be humanely shot or at least taken to a hospital
for a few years....

With the release of their first ever fighting game, SEGA has broken new
ground by designing the only current martial arts game whose appeal isn't
violence or the ever popular 'magic' moves, but more geared towards
realism, fluidity of motion, and genuine martial art techniques. 

The ability to so successfully meet these goals is due to SEGA's System 1
polygon graphics engine which is much like the system  used in their
popular Virtua Racer.  This system can handle over 180,000 flat shaded
polygons per second, and since the fighters are three-dimensional figures
made of polygons instead of just flat images, be prepared to be dazzled by
more than just the backgrounds.

As for the game itself, Virtua Fighter plays like other recent fighting
games in some respects.  There are 8 characters to choose from, and the
basic object of the game is to, through the use of punches, kicks, throws,
grabs, pounces, and a variety of other techniques, drain your opponent's
life meter. The problem is that at this point Virtua Fighter already shows
its differences from other fighting games because you can also win by
knocking your opponent out of the ring.  Another difference is that Virtua
Fighter has many more special moves than any previous fighting game; there
are over 100 secret techniques to discover.  Not to mention that it just
feels more like a real battle due to the fluid motion and realistic moves.


Needless to say, Virtua Fighter is destined to be remembered as both a
great one on one martial arts game and a spectacular fighting simulator. 
If you haven't seen one yet, then go check it out at your local arcade.

Otherwise, check out the moves and strategies in this FAQ and then use
them to help you master this exciting game before someone else gets ahead
of you.

+==================+
|PREFACE TO VF2 FAQ|
+==================+
This FAQ borrows quite heavily from the original VF1 FAQ. Apart from the
new moves, many of the old moves are taken from the VF1 FAQ. 

VF2 is indeed a worthy successor to the original VF and has brought
fighting games to new heights. Apart from a new graphics engine (System
2), it boasts two new and rather unorthodox characters with equally
unorthodox fighting styles to match. 

To minimize much confusion in this FAQ, almost all moves are considered to
be taps. Hold down joystick moves are highlighted as such moves will only
work properly when the stick is held down. Experimentation with moves has
also revealed that most moves require the simultaneous tapping of joystick
and buttons. A good example would be Jacky's Punt Kick which is now "for,
for+K" instead of "for, for, K". Due to complex button and joystick
combinations for certain moves, the holding of the defend button feature
for some moves we know of in VF1 has been removed, so I have decided not
to highlight this option. Enjoy the FAQ.

+=======+
|BUTTONS|
+=======+

     WHILE STANDING
     ==============
     PUNCH   - Steps forward with a punch
               Repeat for multiple punches

     KICK    - A kick to the head
               Not too powerful or effective

     DEFEND  - Blocks your opponents' high level and jumping attacks
               You take no damage from such attacks
               Low attacks do damage
               You are still pushed backwards

     WHILE SQUATTING
     ===============
     PUNCH   - Low punch; hits standing defenders
               Stays in one place; quite weak and ineffective
               Good for stopping incoming high attacks
               If your character does not have a back/down+P or down+P
               special move or combo, these are alternative ways
               to execute a low punch.


     KICK    - Low snap kick to the leg; very weak
               Hits standing
               Longer reach than a low punch, but slower
               Good for stopping incoming high attacks
               Good for setting up combos and power attacks
               Able to stop low attacks if executed in time
               Able to push opponents back
               If your character does not have a back/down+K or down+K
               special move or combo, these are alternative ways
               to execute a low kick.

     DEFEND  - Defends against all low attacks
               Ducks under many standing attacks
               Most jumping/hopping  and mid-level attacks hit
               Some moves may still push you back

NOTE: defense doesn't work for attacks from behind

Note: You can make two jumping attacks per jump now. One at take-off and
another just before you land. Various combinations can be achieved. Like
take-off jump kick with a distance jumping hammer upon landing or take-off
jump kick with a landing kick upon landing. Kage and Pai's special jumping
attacks cannot be used in combination with other jumping attacks.

\===============================+=====+===================================/

+=========+
|OPERATION|
+=========+
Before we start, on fighting techniques, below is the basic operation in VF.

    +========================+
    |SELECTING YOUR CHARACTER|
    +========================+
    Just highlight your character and tap P, K or D. 

    To select alternate colors of the character, hold the joystick up and
    tap the buttons. 

    +=======+
    |REPLAYS|
    +=======+    
    After a set, a replay will take place. If you find that the replay is
    irritating, may bypass it by tapping the START button. Be careful to tap
    your own player start button. If someone has put in some tokens and you
    tap the other player button, you have accidently forced someone to play
    against you or worse challenged yourself as the tokens inside are yours. 

    There is more you can do during the replays and this will be covered in
    the EASTER EGGS section

+====================+
|CONTROLLER TECHNIQUE|
+====================+
The new boxes that are used for VF2 are now standard. The button positions
form some form of circular arc which aid your fighting technique if you
position for fingers properly. 

    +========+
    |JOYSTICK|
    +========+
    The joystick is best held rather loosely. The are 3 main ways to hold the
    joystick in VF: 

    1. Thumb and fingertips: Very much the same as you would hold an
    eyedropper. It gives somewhat firm control for the diagonal movements.
    Good response for taps in any direction using thumb or fingertips.
    Recommended technique. 

    2. Engulfing: The ball on the stick is completely grasped into a fist.
    This is not recommended though some have found this technique comfortable
    for rolling actions in Akira's Dashing Palm or Wolf's Twirl and Hurl. 

    3. In-between: The stick is in-between the index finger and the middle
    finger with palm facing upwards. Great control over up, down, forward and
    back motions but lends poor control over diagonals. I've seen this
    technique in one person who has tiny hands. So it is recommended for
    people with little hands I think. 

    4. Situational: The use of 2 or all of the above techniques as the
    situation demands. 

    +=======+
    |BUTTONS|
    +=======+
    The recommended technique is to use 3 digits for each of the buttons.
    Personally, I think switching from button to button using a finger is
    rather ineffecient though it is possible in VF1. In VF2 the moves
    especially the elbow-knee and elbow-heel kick combo of the Bryants
    require you to be fast. The recommended finger positioning is: 

    Defend: Thumb
    Punch : Index finger
    Kick  : Middle finger

    An alternate way for big hands is:

    Defend: Index finger
    Punch : Middle finger
    Kick  : Ring finger

+===============+
|ROUNDS AND SETS|
+===============+
The action is VF is divided into rounds. In each round, you would spar the
opposing character. Each round is further divided into sets. Depending how
your arcade manager setups the box, rounds can be divided into 2/3, 3/5,
4/7 or 5/9 sets. 

+======================+
|VERSUS COMPUTER COMBAT|
+======================+
If you choose to fight with the computer, the opponents follow in the 
order below:

Lau
Sarah
Shun
Pai
Lion
Jeffry
Kage
Jacky
Wolf
Akira
Dural

The last fight which is a bonus stage is a battle between your character 
and Dural. This takes place underwater amongst the ruins of the sunken 
city of Atlantis. Action is in slow motion due to fluid viscosity.

    +============+
    |RANKING MODE|
    +============+
    If you choose to fight against computer controlled opponents, you may 
    invoke the "ranking mode". This allows the computer to grade your 
    fighting skills. Upon completion of the game (beating Akira but not 
    necessarily Dural), the computer gives recommendations to improve 
    your technique. However, if you get beaten halfway through, a grade 
    will only be given.

    If someone challenges you to a duel, ranking mode is not cancelled if
    you defeat the challenger. You cannot continue ranking mode if you are
    defeated by the computer.

    To invoke ranking mode, tap all three buttons and press start together.
    Current observations seem to suggest that the computer awards more 
    points for:

    1.	Floating your opponents.

    2.	Behind throws.

    You can beat all computer opponents easily by just throwing, but what 
    you get would just be 9th grade.

+======================+
|ENTERING YOUR INITIALS|
+======================+
There is some general confusion in entering your initials. Actually it is
rather simple. Just hold the D button and move the joystick left or right
to select the character. The trick is to look at the characters changing
at the bottom of the screen. Once highlighted, release Defend and run
towards the character. You are to knock the character down and not just
hit it to get it entered. Once a character is entered, you can erase it
with a backspace by highlighting the backspace. Be careful and quick when
entering the characters. You have 30 seconds to do this only. 

You can only enter your initials after you beat Akira and made it to the 
op 20 fastest completion times. Beating Dural is optional.

+============+
|SUDDEN DEATH|
+============+
If the last deciding round happens to be a draw, the game goes to sudden
death where the fight takes place on a ring which size is 1/16th of the
original. The object is to mainly RO the opponent as a decider for that
round. If the sudden death is a draw, the challenger is the loser. If you
are playing against the computer, the player loses if a draw happens;
which is most unlikely. 

+===========================+
|GENERAL FIGHTING TECHNIQUES|
+===========================+
This part covers some basic fighting techniques in VF2. Please note that
VF2 is still a ground based game. SEGA has made air attacks in this game
fairly worthless. Though now with increased speed, aerial attacks are
still rather quite slow. Hopping attack speeds are however improved, so
they are now more useful. To make matters worse for jump kickers from VF1,
computer controlled opponents are able to return a jump kick to your
character once a jump kick is missed. 

The guide below is just a basic guide. Most are borrowed from the VF1 FAQ.
It is by no means a formula to successful VFing. A flexible fighting
technique is needed for human versus human fights. This is also required
for versus computer fights since the computer now remembers the moves that
are successfully used against it and will defend itself against these same
attacks. 

Now then, the techniques... 

+================+
|A FLURRY OF JABS|
+================+
By simply tapping the punch button repeatedly, your character, whomever he
(or she) may be, will step forward and punch as they go.  They will punch
2-3 times and then pause for a second before they can begin to attack
again.

Works good...

*   when your enemy has very little life left
*   when your enemy is close to the edge of the ring (to get a RO)
*   sometimes to start the round out with
*   if they are in the air, you can usually hit them with an attack, and
    follow that up with two or three punches before they hit the ground
    Jeffry, Lau, and Wolf can tag on their uppercut/knife hand to make a more
    deadly combo whenever they catch someone in the air with a punch or a 
    kick if you tag on the kick part of their combos


Works bad...

*   if you use it too much and the opponent counters with a low attack

+===============+
|HOPPING ATTACKS|
+===============+
With the increased speed in VF2, hopping attacks can be used to counter
low attacks. Very useful against opponents who are getting up to sweep
you. Hop kicks are useful against low defenders though they are quite weak
in terms of damage inflicted. Hopping hammers and jabs inflict heavy
damage. However, they cannot attack low or standing defenders. They are
more useful at close range when a low attack is expected. 

Some characters' hopping kicks are just pure deception. Kage, Lau, Shun 
and Lion have toe slides or sweeps in place of a hop kick. This can be 
achieved by tapping K while descending from the hop.

+===============+
|JUMPING ATTACKS|
+===============+
Jumping and kicking immediately works well if they are really close to
you. You can catch them off guard if they are closing in with a fury of
jabs. 

This attack also hits a low defenders. Therefore it is very valuable to
people who don't have many other attacks which can hit a squatting opponent.

If they aren't close, then you have three options.

     +==================+
     |DISTANCE DROP KICK|
     +==================+
     Has deceptive range.  Probably the best distance attack.  You must
     hit the kick button before you reach the peak of your jump.  You can 
     only be hit out of it if your opponent does a close jumping kick before 
     your kick comes out and that is a very hard move to time (of which the 
     computer opponents do so well). This works well as an ambush attack 
     as well. As an opponent closes in with punches, jump overhead him 
     and drop kick him from behind since defend does not work for attacks 
     behind. 

     +=============+
     |LANDING KICKS|
     +=============+
     If you hit the kick when descending from a jump, you will kick before
     you land. This does have benefits as you can surprise someone who 
     thinks you are easy meat after a failed jumping attack.
     
     +===============+
     |OVERHEAD HAMMER|
     +===============+
     You need to hit the punch button before you reach the peak of your
     jump. Better than the mid air kick, but not as good as the drop kick.

VF2 allows you to have two jumping attacks per jump. It may surprise many
who do not know this. However, do not be complacent. Jumping kicks are
still desperation moves and recovery from a jumping attack is slow leaving
you vulnerable to any attack or worse, a throw. 

+========+
|RING OUT|
+========+
Knocking your opponent out of the ring is a perfectly legitimate way to
win a set.  The simplest way to accomplish this is, when they are close to
the edge, to use a fury of jabs or a sweep since these attacks will push
them backwards even if they defend. Squatting kicks are rather good too as
your character will skip forwards for the kick.

Note that Kage's flying kick pushes people back very far, and that Wolf's
spinning throw can throw the person out of the ring if you are lucky for
that, try to have your back to the edge since that is the direction that
he finally lets them fly. Akira's close-in ram can knock lighter opponents
like Lion, Sarah and Pai out of the ring from just off the center of the
ring. Jeffry's flying butt attack is to push people out too.

+======================+
|WAITING FOR YOUR BREAK|
+======================+
One of the more successful defenses can be to simply just crouch and sit
below your opponents attacks until they pause in their attack.  You can
then counter with one of the following. 

     * a power move -- like Kage's heel kick, Wolf's Shoulder Ram or
       Akira's double motion snap kick.

     * a throw -- just perform the motion for the throw you would like to
       do. Characters are easy targets for throws while they recover from 
       moves such as high kicks and missed pounces and jumps. 

     * a combo or combination attack -- like Jacky's elbow-heel kick combo
       or Sarah's elbow-knee combo

+===========================+
|DODGING AND COUNTER-ATTACKS|
+===========================+
With the increased speed in VF2, you can execute dodges and
counter-attacks at a moments notice. Most characters have a dodge and
punch move or some sort of counter-attack equivalent to Pai's defensive
grab. 

There are many ways you can counter-attack. Everytime you see an attack
coming, just back off and retaliate while the opposing character recovers.
Just be imaginative. For example, backward kickflips duck under many
punches. Use this to your advantage. 

In the case of those defensive grabs. It is best to set up your opponent
to make that crucial move you want them to make. On purpose in previous
sets, make yourself vulnerable to a particular move like a side kick or
punch for a certain situation. Then present this same situation to them
and grab their attack. It is all up to your head to set up the "sting". An
example would be to present yourself as vulnerable after Akira's dashing
elbow to punch-kick combos. Then after a set, do a dashing elbow, hold D
then back+P when you know the opponent's punch is incoming. This is what
they mean by using these counter-attacks with finesse. This applies to all
characters with a defensive counter-attack. 

+======================+
|ATTACKING WHILE RISING|
+======================+
When an opponent knocks you down, you can get up with an attack. There are
many ways to do it thus giving you many variations. Rising attacks
depending on how they are executed will hit either low or standing
defenders. However, a missed rising attack with an opponent nearby spells
a free attack on your character. It is wiser to use the rolling away
attacks as they get you away from the action and discourages throws from
players that follow you through the roll hoping for a free throw. 

All characters are vulnerable to rising attacks after a missed pounce. If
your opponent plays a character that misses most of his pounces like Wolf
and Jeffry, do a rising attack. 

Do not do too many rising attacks as most experienced players would rather
back off after a successful attack. Players with characters that have some
form of long distance attack like Kage (Flying kick) or Sarah (Toe kick
and side kick) would take the opportunity to attack from a distance with
these moves. Be careful when you get up or you may find yourself trying to
get up again. 

Countering rising attacks now are more difficult. However, if your
opponent gets a bit too predictable, you can: 

     * do a hopping attack in response to any sweep. Hopping hammers and
       jabs are good as they do the most damage.

     * defend in response to a kick or sweep. Attack them with your best
       depending on how they respond. If they defend, throw them. If they 
       think they can sneak some additional attacks after a missed rising 
       attack, muster your best attack against them. 

Getting a bit too predictable can be a psychological weapon as well. Do
rising attacks different from previous attacks to make your opponent think
he's got you figured out. 

Sometimes do an attack that allows you to fall flat on the ground. Shun's
attacks are a fine example. Falling flat on the ground after an attack
tempts your opponent to come closer especially for an opportunistic throw.
Kick or sweep them as they come near since recovery from such moves are
faster. This may be dangerous as characters now can kick or punch
opponents on the ground. 

+==========================+
|HIT 'EM WHILE THEY'RE DOWN|
+==========================+
NEARLY every time you knock your opponent down you should try for a
pounce. 

Pounce ranges in VF2 are much shorter that in VF1. Sarah and Kage do not
have unlimited pounce ranges anymore. The motions for pounces (up+P) can
be done the moment your opponent starts falling. You can also time your
pounces to hit someone trying to get up. The damage is even more severe in
this case. Imagine Jeffry's entire butt landing on your head! 

On top of pouncing, characters can use alternative attacks against fallen
opponents. Kicks, punches to the ground, elbow drops are some of the few.
They are fast and rather efficient. These attacks will not keep the
opponent on the ground for long. Each kick or punch will move them
further away from your character, therefore each subsequent attack can
fail opening you up for a rising attack. At most get two of these attacks
in and back off. The motion for these attacks like pounces can be done
when the opponent starts falling. However, these alternative moves
require you to be close to the fallen opponent to connect. 

+============+
|KICKFLIPPING|
+============+
All the characters except for Akira, Jeffry, and Wolf can backflip. Those
who can backflip can do a type of attack called kickflipping, which is a
high backwards flip in which the legs can hit the opponent and do major
damage besides looking just totally cool. Lion does not backflip but
cartwheels. Shun is able to backflip but does not have a kickflip.

There are two kinds of kickflips. Backward kickflips and kickflips. In
backward kickflips, the exponent backflips doing a handstand and kicks as
he/she is flipping backwards. Kickflips are performed as the exponent
kicks into the air and flips without ground contact until landing.
Backward kickflips and kickflips hits opponents jumping in though
kickflips gain more altitude thus giving a higher chance of a successful
hit. 

Only Pai, Lau, Kage, Sarah and Jacky have kickflips. Of the five, Jacky
does not have a kickflip combo. Kage has two different kickflips at his
disposal. 

All kickflips and their combos hit low defenders which is a feature not 
seen in VF1.

+====================+
|TURNING AROUND MOVES|
+====================+
These moves are new and cool in VF2. Most fast characters have attacks
that turn them around to face their back at the opponent. These attacks
can be used in conjunction with turn around and face opponent attacks.
This opens up new opportunities for positional play. To play this way, one
must have a clear mind on the direction.

If you choose to turn around with a punch, this turn around punch can be 
executed as part of a punch combo. So these moves can be used to set up 
ambushes and combos.

The bad thing about this is that if you are caught with your back on an
opponent, the end may be drawing near. 

Control motions for turn around moves are "back, back+BUTTONS. To execute
it properly, you MAY have to hold the second "back" motion. This is
advantageous as you can tap the buttons twice to execute the same move
twice. First to turn away from the opponent and the second to turn and
face the opponent. This can be good for characters like Kage who has many
turn around moves, he can have a combination of turn around moves. 

+===========+
|HARRASSMENT|
+===========+
Squatting and kick together will produce a harrassment kicks to the leg.
These kicks are fast but are very weak. Their use as combo stoppers are
good as they have a good reach. They can be used to attack an already
weakened opponent for a KO. When used in conjunction with low punches,
they can be a major source of irritation for combo maniacs. Low punches
are good to set up for throws as well. All in all, low attacks are a major
irritation to many. Lion's low swipe kicks are so good they are a special 
move all by itself.

Low punches and kicks can also be used to force an opponent to block low
for major attacks against low defenders. Sarah's squatting kick is fast
and if the defender blocks low for these kicks, her arsenal of attacks
against low defenders can be unleashed. 

Low punches and kicks are however not good if someone has you figured out.
All characters have moves that attack characters staying low and all of
them wreak tremendous havoc. Even Pai has a scissors kick that can spell
trouble to anyone punching or kicking low. Jeffry and Wolf have throws
that are very painful against low attackers who fail in their attacks. So,
as much as possible, do not overuse these moves. 

+========+
|AMBUSHES|
+========+
Due to the fast pace of action in VF2, you may find yourself behind facing
an opponents back. You can start combos or do behind throws from that
position. To set yourself up behind an opponent can be pure chance or pure
cunning as with Akira. His Surprise exchange pull and Backwards uppercut
can be used to do an all important knock out move or ring out. 

Also, distance drop kicks to the back can be achieved on rising opponents.
This is a good ambush maneuver though very underhanded does the job pretty
well. Just jump forward till you are overhead the rising opponent and drop
kick his back. The timing and distance in this move is crucial. 

If you do find yourself about to be ambushed from behind, you can:

     * turn with an attack. This is particularly useful if someone wants
       to throw you. Turning around with a low attack (down+K) is 
       particularly useful.

     * run. It is okay to run like a chicken at such a situation. Attacks
       and throws from behind are devastating. It is the only way to escape 
       from a drop kick from behind. 


+==============================+
|PULLING BACK A KICK OR A PUNCH|
+==============================+
To pull back a kick, press the kick button, and then press the D button
before your kick has been raised above your knee. This works for punch too
but you have to be faster. What you do after that is up to you, but your
opponent will probably block. You can either throw them or attack them
with a move that their defending position is vulnerable to. 

+====================+
|DELAYED ACTION MOVES|
+====================+
Combos and special moves that have many motions can be done with delayed
action. A fine example is the P, P, P, K combos. Tap the three Ps quickly,
then pause for a few milliseconds before tapping K. What you get is three
punches, a short pause and the kick move. Lau players have been known to
use this very often to fool opponents. Sarah and Jacky's elbow combos can
do this too if you hold the joystick forward after the elbow before
tapping K milliseconds later. There are many moves that can do this. 
Discover these yourself. 

+==============================+
|THROWING AND CLOSE RANGE MOVES|
+==============================+
Throwing and other close range moves can only be done at punch range.
Besides being close to the opponent, you have to have the correct foot
positioning. Which is feet positioning that does not mirror the opponents.
Your character's left foot if it is in front should correspond to the
opposing character's right foot which is a step behind his left. So from
top view it should look as: 

             Character A      Character B

                       X            X
                  X           X

This would present a throw opportunity if range permits. A throw can be
done even when the feet positions mirror one another but it is just more
difficult to get out. Depending on the type of throw, the control motions,
especially "for, for" motions; throws can be done with incorrect feet
positioning. Most characters have to run forward or perform foot changing
moves to change feet positioning. 

    +=======================+
    |PUNCH THROW THECHNIQUES|
    +=======================+
    If an opponent tends to try to close distance with you by moving
    forward, try punch and throwing him.  Do a single punch, crouching or 
    standing, followed QUICKLY by the motion for the throw you want to 
    do. If the punch connects, there is a good chance they will still be
    in range for a throw. "Heavy" fighters, such as Jeffry and Wolf, are
    particularly vulnerable, since the punch will hardly move them at all. 

    The punch is fast enough to interrupt any attack the opponent may be
    attempting, and the throw if done correctly will come out while they are
    still reeling from the punch.  Even if the opponent blocks, the throw 
    will connect so long as you are close enough. 

    Typical Punch and Throw techniques are Kage's Punch and Toss (P, back+P),
    Wolf's Punch and Twirl (P, back, SCR, for+P) and Lau's Punch and Head 
    Slam (P, back, for+P). 

    +===============+
    |ESCAPING THROWS|
    +===============+
    You can escape all P+D throws and Jeffry's body press only. To escape 
    from a P+D throw, tap P+D the moment the opponent begins to throw you.
    To be extra sure, you can tap P+D continuously as the throw begins as
    if you are getting up after being knocked down. What you do after
    successfully escaping from the throw is up to you. Wolf's Backfall suplex
    is particularly vulnerable to attacks as the the escapee falls upright
    just behind him. 

    You cannot escape from complex control motion throws and behind throws.
    When throwing experienced opponents, it is best to use complex control
    motion throws. However, P+D throws are given preference if both players
    executes the throws at the same time. So it may be safe to use P+D throws
    in some situations. Its all up to you. 

+==================+
|HIT 'EM IN THE AIR|
+==================+
Sometimes characters play a little hand-ball with their opponents by
repeatedly punching, uppercutting and otherwise bouncing them along in the
air. Lau is the true master of this technique, able to bounce opponents up
to eight times in a single combination of moves. With the increased speed
in VF2, almost all characters are able to do this better than in VF1. 

There are many combination attacks that keep opponents in the air.
Possible combinations are: 

     * Knee and uppercuts for Jeffry
     * Knee and running punches for Wolf
     * Toss and flying kick for Kage
     * Aerial jumping turn kick, rising knee combo and kickflip for Sarah
     * Any attack from Shun followed by 3 breakdance sweeps
     * Any of Lion's moves followed by his low swipe kicks

The list goes on. Discover these yourself.

A rule of thumb is to lower the height level of your attacks. Start out
attacking high. If the opponent is hit, keep him in the air. As he/she
starts falling, progress to mid level attacks, then finally to low level
attacks. 

+================================+
|DEVELOPING YOUR OWN COMBINATIONS|
+================================+
You have to develop your own combinations. One lovely system to develop 
combinations is what I call the "common joystick motion" system. For 
example, let us take a look at Akira.

Akira has a close range defense breaking move called the shake 'em up. 
Its control motion is back+P+D. He also has a dashing body check and its
motions are back, for, for+P+K. You can combine these two moves into a
beautiful move because both share a common motion and that is back. So
what you do is: 

back+P+D, for, for+P+K

This would effectively give you a shake 'em up to soften their defenses 
and a dashing body check to the opponent.

Here is another example you might consider. Again we will use Akira. There
are 2 Akira moves that require him to stay low first and these are his
dashing palm moves. So his combination can be developed as: 

down+P or down+K, for+P for a low punch or kick followed by a palm.

This works very well as Akira does not have any special move that have the
motion of down+P or down+K. Effectively, you get a low kick or punch with
this motion by tapping down and the respective buttons. This makes Akira
squat first for the low punch or kick, then tap forward and punch for the
single palm. There is no need to roll the stick forward. If you need a
double palm, do a low punch or kick followed by back then forward and
punch. 

Just study your characters' moves and check out which moves have common
motions. Develop your own combinations and have fun! 

+===============+
|LISTEN AND LOOK|
+===============+
Above all be alert. Listen for loud bangs from the speaker that signify a
damaging hit that would knock the opponent out cold for some time. This
would help you know when to pounce. Also, listen for powerful moves that
make whistling noises. If they hit, the opponent is also knocked down cold
for some time. Small "bish" noises usually signify a minor hit. Pouncing
after this may land you into trouble. 

Keep your eyes on the opposing character and judge the distances. Above
all practice till the moves come out instinctively even without you
looking at your character. 

+===========+
|EASTER EGGS|
+===========+

    +==================+
    |SLOW MOTION REPLAY|
    +==================+
    If a particular finishing is funny, gross, painful, humiliating or
    spectacular; you may opt for a slow motion replay. As you KO, RO or TO
    your opponent, hold down all three buttons to effect the slow motion
    replay option. You are only allowed one slow motion replay per entire
    game.

    +==============+
    |VICTORY TAUNTS|
    +==============+
    Another nice touch to replays is the victory taunts and phrases. You 
    can actually control what your character says. During the replay, 
    hold down either P, K, or D to select the taunts. Win a set under ten 
    seconds and your character will say the "below ten second taunt".

    +=======================+
    |GAME COMPLETION REPLAYS|
    +=======================+
    If you complete the game, the replays of all the stages will be played.
    The trailing animation frame shadows for these replays can be controlled.
    Tap All left player buttons to decrease the frames and the right player
    buttons to increase the frames.

    +================+
    |KAGE'S FACE MASK|
    +================+
    Kage's face mask will only fall off if he wins 20 straight wins from
    challengers. He has no scar on his cheek anymore and he is described as
    rather handsome.

+====================+
|MYSTERIES AND RUMORS|
+====================+
If you would notice, the name of the character just below the lifebar will
flash when certain moves from your character connects.

There are rumors floating around saying Jeffry has a Skybreaker. This is a
backbreaker done from a body press position. It is therefore different
from his normal backbreaker or even his behind backbreaker. Any info is
appreciated.

|CHARACTER GUIDE|
+===============+
AKIRA YUKI
==========
Hakkyoku-ken, one of the foremost Chinese martial arts.

During the Second World War, the Japanese arm developed their own 
Hakkyoku-ken techniques to improve their infantry's fighting ability.

Akira Yuki is the son of the man who developed these techniques. He 
serves as the assistant instructor at Yuki Budokan. Hot-blooded and 
impulsive by nature, he also can be naive and intemperate.

After completing his training under his father's tutelage at the age of 
23, he went on a quest to test his abilities.

When he got word of this world championship fighting tournament, he 
decided to enter

Editor's Notes
--------------
According to rumors, SEGA wanted very much Akira to be the "star" 
character of VF1. They didn't do very well and so Jacky became more or 
less the star. This is attributed to the difficulty in using Akira as a 
playing character in VF. They decided to make Akira stronger for VF2 as a 
result. He is truly Mr Dynamite now.

Eight Poles Fist actually stresses more on counter-attacks. If you look
carefully at all of Akira's moves, they either require him to duck first
(dashing palm) or attack low (dashing elbow). These are in a true essence
aggressive counter-attacks. With the newly added counter-attack moves and
defense breaking ability from Akira, he is in fact the most formidable
character in VF2. 

Fighting with Akira
-------------------
He has his main strength in his special moves and close range moves. 
Almost all of those multi-punch and kick combos have be removed since not
many people use them anyway. The speed of all his special attacks would
more than compensate for this. Use them all to your advantage.

Playing with Akira would mean pure aggressive play. The increased speed in
VF2 would mean his special moves would come out faster. I have seen many
Akira players do five continuous dashing elbows in a row to RO an
opponent. Cheesy it may seem but that is the level of aggressiveness he
should be played. 

His close range moves are rather deceptive than powerful. Only his trip
and punches; the pull in, throw out; and close-in ram can knock an
opponent down.  The rest of the close range moves allow him for free
strikes based on confusion created by these moves. The insidious surprise
exchange is a good example. 

Though Akira is fast in his attacks, the recovery from these attacks are 
slow. The notorious dashing body check is the slowest in its recovery and 
exposes Akira's back to the opponent momentarily. However, he has his 
counter-attacks to make up for this. These counter-attacks are precisely 
used to defend Akira from attacks after his special moves. This makes him 
even more dangerous in attack or defense.

To do his counter-attack, the D button is compulsory. You can either tap 
it or hold it prior to the back+P, back/down+P or down+P motion. 
According to the way he is attacked, the counter-attacks come out in 8 
variations; more or less influenced by the counter-attack control 
motions. It is most essential to learn his counter-attacks to harness 
Akira's full potential. All his counter-attacks are very damaging and can 
push opponents far away.

PAI CHAN
========
She is a leading star in Hong Kong action films.

Her moods change as quickly as a cat's - she can erupt in passion in one 
minute, and turn icy cold in the next.

Lau's only daughter, Pai was especially trained by her father in martial 
arts from a young age. Lau was jealous of her superior abilities, 
however, so she ran away from home at 16 when her mother died.

Two years later, she was a success in the movie industry. When she 
recieved word that her father was going to enter the world championship 
fighting tournament, she also decided to enter.

Editor's Notes
--------------
Pai, the "weak" little girl of VF1 is better than before. Now there are
not many Pai players but there is one I met that could trash any Sarah
player. She is mainly used by her fans and die-hards. 

Crane Fist is accurately copied and depicted in VF. Crane Fist is known
very much for grabbing attacks. Not necessarily to throw but to stop
attackers from delivering their blows. A Shaolin based technique, it is in
a true sense a very defensive technique. 

This technique is also graceful to watch and Pai's double scissors kicks
is a move to behold in slow motion. 

Playing with Pai
----------------
Pai's strength is still her parry. She is fast and avoiding attacks is
easy with Pai. She still has a weakness for low defenders but that is
partially solved with her downward slap and scissors kicks. Her combos
come out fast but would leave her totally vulnerable to throws if they
fail to connect. Believe me, nobody in the right mind would want to punch
or kick Pai. 

Her back+P counter-attack is now more versatile and can grab a variety of
attacks. Playing her is exactly the opposite of Akira. Pure defense. Her
throws are rather fast and for anyone running up to her hoping for a free
throw must be nuts. Her punches are fast enough to counter any would be
throwers. For anyone closing in with punches, she can just back off easily
due to the speed of her quick step back. Depending on the range they are
closing in, a quick step back followed by her grab and attack would deter
most. 

All in all, concentrate on defense. Only use her combos to retaliate 
throwers. Throw all those dumbfounded defenders afraid of attacking her. 
Above all, set up your "stings". Her falling DDT and stomach throw can RO 
many. Use the pushover throw to avoid ROs

LAU CHAN
========
A leading Chinese chef, he is also a master of the legendary Koen-ken 
martial art. A quiet man, he nevertheless has the air of resourcefulness 
and skill seen only in those skilled in the art of Koen-ken. His cold 
appearance belies a gentle nature.

He achieved one of his life's ambitions when he was awarded the Grand Prix
at the world's most renowned competition for Chinese chefs. Now, he is
ready to fulfill his next ambition. He is resolved to enter the world
championship fighting tournament and achieve his ultimate goal. 

Editor's Notes
--------------
Lau is still the Super Ring Outer. Once you are caught by the knife hand 
or equivalent, you better stop tapping those buttons. A dashing knife 
followed by a full volley of punches and crescent would usually mean the end.

This style of fighting actually stresses simplicity in its strokes but
each stroke filled with every ounce of force you can muster. It does not
stress on speed in attacks. However, this version used by Lau has speed.
Only moves like the knife hand and the lifting palm retain this power. The
speed is mainly in his punches and kicks. 

Playing with Lau
----------------
Lau indeed has the speed and he has the power. This is the guy that made
Jacky players re-evaluate their prowess. Mix up all your attacks. Do a
combination of high and low attacks. Do not start your combos unless your
knife hand or lifting palm hits. Both these moves either stun or lifts
opponents high into the air. There is plenty of time to float them. 

Use the punches and sweep combo for opponents who are heavy or falling
fast. The punches and kickflip is good for ROs as they fling opponents 
far away. At any situation, try to make the crescent in the punches and 
crescent combo connect. A pounce after would end everything.

With this speed, you may think getting all these in is good enough. No! 
Lau's strength is in his punches. Everyone knows that. Have Akira, Pai,
Kage or Wolf opposing you and you are going to have a difficult time. 
These characters possess counter-attack moves. One grab or counter-attack
and this would end your assault.

It is here where his throws are useful. Because of his speed in punches,
most would prefer a defend and wait attitude when playing against Lau.
Just throw these defenders. His sideways throw is the most useful now. One
sideways throw leaves Lau standing and ready; a dashing knife hand
connects well straight after. If you need further damage, carry on with
his punches and insert your favorite kick here.  What you will see is Lau
going totally psycho punching the ribs of the thrown opponent. 

His side kick is still fast but with counter-attacks from other 
characters, you have to use it judiciously.

To play with Lau is to play with caution. Learn to do his combos at the 
opportune time but don't forget his basic moves.

WOLF HAWKFIELD
==============
He lived as a woodsman and hunter in the Canadian wilderness until he was 
discovered on a scouting trip by a professional wrestling promoter. A 
quiet man who loves nature, he has his gentle side. He is filled with 
fighting spirit, however. Once aroused, he is not satisfied until he 
finishes the job at hand.

He was an instant star in the pro wrestling area, and successfully
defended his title several times. Dissatisfied with the level of
competition, however, he turned in his belt and retired from the ring. 

He entered the world championship fighting tournament in search of a 
rival worthy of his abilities.

Editor's Notes
--------------
He is big and huge now. Have moves and looks of a real wrestler. He is 
fast becoming a favorite among many due to all those fabulous throws.

Professional wrestling technique? Well, TV has many fine examples of pro 
wrestling techniques. I don't think I need to explain this.

Playing with Wolf
-----------------
As usual, go for throws. I would however go easy on the backfall suplex. 
Any intended victim escapes and you are in trouble.

His aerial attacks are magnificent and deadly. Learn to defend stoutly 
but insert a few attacks here and there. His uppercuts are still slow 
compared to Jeffry's but his body blow has tremendous range.

Many of his moves are similar to the motions for the throws. Use this to
your advantage. The upward two-hand slap has almost the same motion for
the twirl and hurl. At close range you may get a twirl and hurl but at
longer range, you have an attack that has very good reach. This applies to
his body blow and his body slam which both apply the same control motion,
for+P. 

At mid range, his side kick is the most useful attack. More powerful than 
the uppercuts, it always knocks down opponents. At close range, his knee 
is good for lifting opponents into the air. If followed by an uppercut 
and running punches, it would push them really far back.

Anytime Wolf is in trouble, he can call upon his drop elbow to assist 
him. This is a wonderful move against opponents relentlessly punching 
hoping to overwhelm Wolf with speed attacks.

Whenever an opponent is down, hit them with his back body splash or elbow 
drop. His jumping elbow drop has very little range and should be used at 
close range. The elbow drop connects easily after all his throws except 
for the frankensteiner.

Be opportunistic for throws at all times. For example, anyone rising with
a low attack be it a sweep or a mule kick is asking for trouble. If the
attack misses Wolf, a tombstone, double arm suplex or a torso takedown is
all it takes to inflict damage. 

JEFFRY MCWILD
=============
A fisherman on the Australian coast, he lived in the salty tang of the 
tides and the hot sun. The most skillful fisherman of his village, he has 
an engaging personality.

He was bested by only one opponent - the giant, eight-meter long, 
man-eating Satan Shark. They fought several battles, and finally met in 
their ultimate match. Jeffry was routed and his boat wrecked, but he 
somehow managed to recover as he hovered on the verge of death. He 
entered the world championship fighting tournament with a vow to build a 
new boat and do battle with the shark again.

Editor's Notes
--------------
Like Wolf, he is huge. Does the name King Kong apply?

Pancratium is actually a very ancient form of martial arts. The Greeks
actually developed it as a sport. Partly stresses on holds and punches. 
Best described as a very technical form of brawling. It has evolved to
many forms and the most famous of which is Mu Thai or Thai Boxing. Truly a
no holds barred fighting technique. 

Playing with Jeffry
-------------------
Use him as you would for Wolf. He is a lot faster than Wolf but he 
recovers just as slow. Use your lower attacks to force opponents to stand 
defending making them vulnerable to your more devastating throws. His 
fireman's carry would leave him entirely open if anyone should escape so 
I would go easy on it too. He does have a slight advantage in this case 
as the escapee falls far behind. His body press would leave him in the 
same vulnerable position as Wolf's backfall suplex if the victim escapes.

His flying butt attack has great range and what better way to humiliate 
low defenders than to sit on them! The best throw he has now is the 
backbreaker. Though the control motions look complicated it is actually 
much easier to do than the crucifix piledriver. If you fail to throw, you 
would most likely get off a butt attack which is not too bad. Defend 
stoutly but as usual, look for breaks for your throws. In VF2, his throws 
against low defenders or attackers is very easy to do. Learn to get them 
all out.

His side kick is as powerful as Wolf's but it has longer reach. Besides 
side kicks, his forward foot thrust and heel axe has good range too. Use 
them to your advantage. They are all rather damaging. The other moves 
like the lunging elbow drop and thrusting head butt have very long 
reaches too.

His pounces are much faster than Wolf's. His butt bomb has much better
range but it is still not good enough. His body splash is worst. He has a
foot stomp so use it when you know opponents are rising fast. Use his
pounces only after throws or kicks that land opponents near to Jeffry. A
body splash after a side kick connects well. 

Do not forget his powerful uppercuts. They are much faster and thus help 
you keep opponents in the air longer.

Just keep the pressure on your opponents. Even the sight of Jeffry adds a 
lot of pressure already.

KAGE-MARU
=========
He was born in the village of Hagakure. Kagemaru is the name given to 
members of the Hagakure clan who work in secret in the shadows of society.

His birthright was to become the tenth-generation Kagemaru. His father, 
the ninth-generation Kagemaru, taught him the fearsome Hagakure fighting 
technique.

One day, his mother, the eighth-generation Tsukikage, was kidnapped by a 
mysterious figure. Nothing was heard of her fate.

Several years later, the village of Hagakure was attacked by an unknown 
force. Kagemaru and his father were out fishing, but quickly returned 
when they saw the blazing village. They were too late, however, and the 
village was destroyed. Kagemaru's father was felled by a bullet from the 
mystery group.

The next morning, Kagemaru salvaged a keepsake from his father, donned 
his costume, and embarked on a journey to prepare himself to take 
vengeance on those who spilled his father's blood.

Editor's Notes
--------------
By far, the character with the greatest improvement. Most likely, he would
be called Mr Versatile (we already have a Mr Dynamite and he is Japanese
also). Makes other game ninjas look rather pale in comparison. Fast rising
as a favorite among many. 

Jujitsu is very ancient as a form of martial arts. In the dark days of
Feudal Japan, the ancient form is known as Ninjitsu. It is not a martial
art but a technique expressedly used for killing. In modern times, the art
form became more civilized and it became a sport very much like Taek Kwon
Do. There are many styles and forms of Jujitsu which explains why Kage's
Jujitsu is Hagakure style; named after the village he is from. Believe it
or not, Jujitsu's main emphasis is on throws and counter-attacks, not
fancy tricky moves. So Kage's fighting technique may best be described as
realistically fictional. 

Playing with Kage
-----------------
Use his range to your advantage. His flying kick, corkscrew kick, back
thrust and heel kick have deceptively long reaches. To aid him against low
defenders, the corkscrew kick works well at far range. He doesn't have any
good combos however. The punches and kickflip is by far the best he has;
and the punches and spin kick is the weakest four hit combo in the game.

His strength is mainly in fancy and tricky moves. His turn around attacks
can connect well and above all; with his new found speed in punches, he
can be played just like Lau. Mixing up his attacks is very easy. Attacking
at high and low, this would confuse many. His most useful tagged on move
is still his backheel sweep. Though his pounces connects well now, the
backheel sweep is still good habit to keep. 

His range of movement is even greater with a cartwheel added. Catching 
him would be difficult if he gets ahead. To play Kage is to play the 
whole ring. Movement must be a top priority for Kage players.

All his throws are so easy to do and solid. The infamous back+P ten foot 
toss is the most useful throw in the whole game. When followed on with 
attacks or combos that cover distance, ROs or KOs are really very easy. 
Throws that land opponents at close range connect well with the heel 
smash. Use this always.

His counter-attack counters incoming punches only. Learn to use them when 
your opponent becomes to predictable. It does quite sizeable damage.

Playing him would mean sticking to the basics. That is all to it. 
Combining all those basic attacks would be the feat that every Kage player
has to develop. Combinations especially with his ten foot toss would be
the ultimate skill Kage players will have to master. 

SARAH BRYANT
============
Sarah is Jacky's sister and the oldest daughter of the Bryant family. 
Filled with curiosity, she quickly becomes embroiled in every situation 
imaginable.

Sarah was suspicious of the circumstances surrounding her brother Jacky's 
racing accident. When she was investigating this accident, the mystery 
group kidnapped her. They use hypnosis to control her actions.

Her innate fighting sense aroused by the hypnotism, Sarah will be sent 
into the tournament to deliver the knock-out blow to her brother Jacky.

Editor's Notes
--------------
Apart from a cleavage, she is loaded with a variety of kicks mainly. 
Still a hot favorite, her speed and seemless ability to link up all her 
moves have won many fans.

First a historical view of this fighting technique. Jeet Kune Do is
authored by Bruce Lee himself. Also known as the Intercepting Fist, it
stresses on speed and above all harrassment. This is true as a Jeet Kune
Do exponent would do things like poke the eyes, kick the groin or even jab
at the throat to irritate or confuse an opponent before lashing out a
power attack move.

Sarah's style of fighting is very different from her brother Jacky. Though
it is from the same school of thought, it is described as very wicked and
mean with no sense of grace. 

Playing with Sarah
------------------
Playing with Sarah is like playing with Akira. Very offensive. She is fast
and this should be used to your advantage. To date, no new throws are
discovered for her. However, the bulldog throw of hers has great range.
This can be used to "encourage" opponents to stay low and be vulnerable to
Sarah's arsenal of attacks against low defenders. 

The strength of Sarah is in combination not combos. Tag on all moves that
connect and you will go far with her. Her speed of movement is fast so
avoiding attacks is just a breeze. Her rising knee combo connects rather
well now and can be followed on with a kickflip. With this new speed in
VF2, Sarah has now earned the same notoriety as Lau for floating
opponents. 

Her turn around moves are fast and powerful. Her turn around punch 
followed by any 4 hit combo would push many back. She does however have a 
sweep but is only useful when her back is facing the opponent.

Her toe kick-side kick has good range and would spell trouble for all who 
miss their rising attacks. The roundhouse kick can jump over many low 
attacks and the same goes to the tornado kick which has even greater 
range. These moves recover slowly and should be used when the opportunity 
allows.

Sarah does not side kick opponents. She shadow kicks them. If a side kick
could hit at close range, make sure you shadow kick them. Most likely all
the three kicks will connect making it a very powerful side kick attack. 

Do not give them any room at all. Punch throw techniques work like a 
charm with her and; low kicks and punches do very well too.

JACKY BRYANT
============
The eldest son of the Bryant family, Jacky is Sarah's brother. He 
maintains his cool in every situation. Those on the Indy racing circuit 
call him the Blue Flash.

Jacky was seriously injured in an accident in the 1990 Indianapolis 500, 
and spent two years in a grueling rehabilitation program. Just when his 
injury had healed, he discovered the existence of the mystery group 
behind the accident. At the same time, his sister Sarah disappeared.

Jacky's battle began as he pursued the trail of the group who held the 
key to these mysteries.

Editor's Notes
--------------
The favorite character of VF1 is still a favorite with many but is toned 
down a lot. Still deadly though.

Though he fights with the same style as Sarah, he does not have the speed 
to match. However, harrassment to opponents apply beautifully to his moves.

In terms of grace and technique, his moves surpass Sarah's.

Playing with Jacky
------------------
He is still not the best at everything. However, like Sarah, combinations 
are the way to go.

His elbow-heel kick is not fearsome anymore as with his punt kick, but his
beat knuckle is really bad for everyone. He still does not possess a
kickflip combo but his kickflip alone is the most powerful kickflip in the
game. Able to take as much as eighty percent of the lifebar, it has left
many wondering why the round ended so fast. 

His spinning backfists, both high and low are much faster. The low
spinning backfist especially can be considered as some form of
counter-attack as it can duck under many punches. A deadly combination for
Jacky involves a low spinning backfist. As opponents charge in punching,
do a single low backfist, elbow, knee then kickflip. This drains the
entire lifebar in an instant. Such is the power of Jacky. 

Combine all his moves. Try to get the trip and hammer throw in and kick
them. His turn around moves are nice to see especially when they connect
but use them carefully. This applies to his crescent and sweep; and the
low spinning kick as well. His lightning kicks is best used sparingly. Try
to do one or two lightning kicks as they would most likely stun opponents. 

Play a balanced game of offense and defense. Play him a little like Pai
and Sarah. Use combos to deter throwers and counter mainly with his low
spinning backfist. You can try using all the fancy stuff he has but don't
be overwhelmed by them. Just like Sarah, use those low kicks and punches. 

SHUN DI
=======

No storyline available yet

Editor's Notes
--------------
There are many bald characters in the video games lately like Wan Fu and 
Nienhalt Sieger. Wonder if it is a trend or do bald guys really rule.

Drunken Fist requires the exponent (not player) to be drunk in the mind
but alert in the body. It stresses more on defensiveness. Ducking and
jumping over attacks. This is true as most of Shun's moves are defensively
offensive (what the hell am I talking about?). They jump, duck and dodge
many attacks. His two hand upside-down push ducking under punches is a
fine example.

Playing with Shun
-----------------
To play him, you have to be totally unpredictable. Stop combos or attacks 
with you backpush. It attacks REALLY LOW so that elbows and knees seldom 
hit you. The only moves that stand a chance are toe kicks, punt kick; and 
kickflips against this move.

Use his jumping attacks like the twisting hook punch to hop over low and
mid-level attacks. You have to be completely reactionary in your 
execution. You have to be alert all throughout and have to have good
reflexes. You can't do a lot of planning for Shun. Play as the situation
goes. You can't outguess opponents either so reflexes are the way. For
example, his cartwheel kick is fast but recovers slowly.  Use this to stop
charging opponents hoping to connect with a throw. 

His falling moves can be good too. These moves evade power attacks after
and the only vulnerable thing is a punch or kick to fallen opponents. Not
much damage will be done with these moves on Shun. Nobody would be crazy
enough to pounce. His rising rotorblade kicks get anyone jumping in. 

As much as possible, dodge attacks if you are a beginner and learn to do
the dodge and dances with punches. Progress onwards to learn the rest. 
Note that all his moves are slow and recover slowly; and if you play him
like any other character in VF2, you are playing him wrong. He can float
opponents in some limited way but that is not his main strength. 

Progress on to hone your reflexes for all his moves. Try to use the dances
with punches and two hand upside-down push at least three times in a
match. Get him drunk (SERIOUS!). His skin complexion turns lobster red the
more he drinks. He not only hits harder but is able to do his triple
sweep. These sweeps can do serious damage on falling opponents after a
connected move. 

LION RAFALE
===========

No storyline available

Editor's Notes
--------------
This Frenchman has a lot of sting as a fighter. He has youth on his side
but is rather weak in most of his attacks. Nimble and small, he fights and
moves like the bug his fighting style is based upon. 

A historical view of this fighting technique reveals that Mantis Fist
actually stress not only in speed but mainly in footwork and grip. This
explains the many wierd ways Lion moves his feet around and the way he
throws his opponents. He winds up and fights in a crouched position which
looks very tiring. Like Shun he can duck under most mid-level attacks like
elbows and knees. Such is the fighting technique. 

Playing with Lion
-----------------
Playing Lion would mean playing closing-in with hit and run tactics. All
his moves enable him to close-in very fast. He is small so he doesn't have
much of a reach. His main strength is actually his throws. They are fast
and difficult to avoid. As much as possible practice his ducking moves. 
It is very useful as many attacks just zip past his head. Fight a balanced
game like you are using Jacky but concentrate on throws at close range. At
further ranges, his spinning to the opponents side counter-attacks are a
good option. This move confuses many. 

His side kicks are the fastest so use them to your advantage. He does have
a knee but it comes out slow; definitely not recommended for low
defenders. Rely more on his faster recovering moves. The uppercut and
downward swipe is good and fast. His long range spinning sweeps are
deceptive as one hits standing defenders and the other hits low defenders.
Use this creatively as an illusion. 

His speed is his greatest asset so keep that in mind. Backing off from 
attacks is pretty easy with him. However, go easy on his low attacks. 
They are fast but recover slow.

It is difficult to float opponents with Lion so you might as well forget
it. The best he can muster is the low swipe kicks, one hand-stand kicks
and his arm spin for falling opponents. However, his knee connects very
well on already airborne opponents. He does not have much combos to muster
against airborne opponents other than the punch, thrust and backfist combo.
